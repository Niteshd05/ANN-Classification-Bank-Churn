# ANN-Classification-Bank-Churn
This is a binary classification model built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn based on features like geography, gender, age, balance, and account activity. The model uses one-hot encoding and feature scaling, and outputs the likelihood of churn to help businesses retain customers.
